                            "before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. i need some structure from
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step
                            i was encouraged to enroll by a former student off theirs who can only say wonderful things
                            about program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                            and i
                            never had to wait long for assistance. the agile term project, in particular, was
                            outstanding.
                            it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                            In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                            experience
                            . it certainly
                            helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                            recommend!
